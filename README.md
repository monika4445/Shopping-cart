#Shopping cart functionality of the e-commerce application

This code is a simple e-commerce application that allows a user to add products to a shopping cart and display the total amount of the products in the cart. It's built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The code is split into three separate files: App.js, ProductList.js, and ShoppingCart.js.

App.js is the main component of the application and serves as the root component. It contains the state of the shopping cart, which is represented by an array of products. The state is managed using the useState hook in React.

The ProductList component is rendered in App.js and displays a list of products with a "Add to Cart" button next to each one. When the user clicks the "Add to Cart" button, the corresponding product is added to the shopping cart. The addToCart function is passed as a prop to the ProductList component, which is then called when the button is clicked. The addToCart function updates the state of the shopping cart by adding the selected product to the array.

The ShoppingCart component is also rendered in App.js and displays the contents of the shopping cart. It takes the cart and setCart props, which are the shopping cart state and the function to update the state, respectively. The component calculates the total amount of the products in the cart by using the reduce method on the cart array.

The component also includes a "Remove" button next to each product in the cart. When the user clicks the "Remove" button, the corresponding product is removed from the shopping cart. The removeFromCart function is defined within the ShoppingCart component and updates the state of the shopping cart by removing the selected product from the array.
